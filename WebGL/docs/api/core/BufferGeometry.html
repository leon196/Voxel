		<h1>[name]</h1>

		<div class="desc">
		This is a super efficient class for geometries because it saves all data in buffers. <br />
		It reduces memory costs and cpu cycles. But it is not as easy to work with because of all the necessary buffer calculations.<br />
		It is mainly interesting when working with static objects.
		</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<div>
		This creates a new [name]. It also sets several properties to a default value.
		</div>


		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h3>.[page:Integer id]</h3>
		<div>
		Unique number of this buffergeometry instance
		</div>
		
		<h3>.[page:Hashmap attributes]</h3>
		<div>
		This hashmap has as id the name of the attribute to be set and as value the buffer to set it to.
		</div>
		
		<h3>.[page:Boolean dynamic]</h3>
		<div>
		When set, it holds certain buffers in memory to have faster updates for this object. When unset, it deletes those buffers and saves memory.
		</div>
		
		<h3>.[page:Array offsets]</h3>
		<div>
		This Array should contain every offset at which the buffers should be rendered. This is important for indexed buffers.
		</div>

		<h3>.[page:Object boundingBox]</h3>
		<div>
		Bounding box.
		<code>{ min: new THREE.Vector3(), max: new THREE.Vector3() }</code>
		</div>

		<h3>.[page:Object boundingSphere]</h3>
		<div>
		Bounding sphere.
		<code>{ radius: float }</code>
		</div>
		
		<h3>.[page:Array morphTargets]</h3>
		<div>
		Array of morph targets. Each morph target is a Javascript object:
		<code>{ name: "targetName", vertices: [ new THREE.Vertex(), ... ] }</code>
		Morph vertices match number and order of primary vertices.
		</div>

		<h3>.[page:boolean hasTangents]</h3>
		<div>
		True if BufferGeometry has tangents. Set in [page:BufferGeometry BufferGeometry.computeTangents].
		</div> 

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>[page:EventDispatcher EventDispatcher] methods are available on this class.</h3>
		
		<h3>.applyMatrix( [page:Matrix4 matrix] )</h3>
		<div>
		Bakes matrix transform directly into vertex coordinates.
		</div>

		<h3>.computeVertexNormals()</h3>
		<div>
		Computes vertex normals by averaging face normals.<br />
		</div>

		<h3>.computeTangents()</h3>
		<div>
		Computes vertex tangents.<br />
		Based on [link:http://www.terathon.com/code/tangent.html]<br />
		Geometry must have vertex [page:UV UVs] (layer 0 will be used).
		</div>

		<h3>.computeBoundingBox()</h3>
		<div>
		Computes bounding box of the geometry, updating [page:Geometry Geometry.boundingBox] attribute.<br />
		Bounding boxes aren't computed by default. They need to be explicitly computed, otherwise they are *null*.
		</div>

		<h3>.computeBoundingSphere()</h3>
		<div>
		Computes bounding sphere of the geometry, updating [page:Geometry Geometry.boundingSphere] attribute.<br />
		Bounding spheres aren't computed by default. They need to be explicitly computed, otherwise they are *null*.
		</div>
		
		<h3>.dispose()</h3>
		<div>
		Disposes the object from memory. <br />
		You need to call this when you want the bufferGeometry removed while the application is running.
		</div>

		<h3>.normalizeNormals()</h3>
		<div>
		Every normal vector in a geometry will have a magnitude of 1.
		This will correct lighting on the geometry surfaces.
		</div>

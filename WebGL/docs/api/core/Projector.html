		<div class="desc">Projects points between spaces.</div>


		<h2>Constructor</h2>


		<h3>[name]()</h3>
		<div>
		Creates a new projector Object. It initializes a lot of variables that the projector uses to project the points.
		</div>
		
		
		<h2>Properties</h2>

		<h2>Methods</h2>

		<h3>.projectVector( [page:Vector3 vector], [page:Camera camera] ) [page:Vector3]</h3>
		<div>
		[page:Vector3 vector] — vector to project.<br />
		[page:Camera camera] — camera to use in the projection.<br />
		</div>
		<div>
		Projects a vector with the camera. Caution, this method changes 'vector'.
		</div>

		<h3>.unprojectVector( [page:Vector3 vector], [page:Camera camera] ) [page:Vector3]</h3>
		<div>
		[page:Vector3 vector] — vector to unproject.<br />
		[page:Camera camera] — camera to use in the projection.<br />
		</div>
		<div>
		Unprojects a vector with the camera. Caution, this method changes 'vector'. 
		</div>
		
		<h3>.pickingRay( [page:Vector3 vector], [page:Camera camera] ) [page:Raycaster]</h3>
		<div>
		Translates a 2D point from NDC (<em>Normalized Device Coordinates</em>) to a [page:Raycaster] that can be used for picking. NDC range from [-1..1] in x (left to right) and [1.0 .. -1.0] in y (top to bottom).
		</div>

		<h3>.projectScene( [page:Scene scene], [page:Camera camera], [page:Boolean sort] ) [page:Object]</h3>
		<div>
		[page:Scene scene] — scene to project.<br />
		[page:Camera camera] — camera to use in the projection.<br />
		[page:Boolean sort] — select whether to sort elements using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's algorithm</a>.
		</div>
		
		<div>
		Transforms a 3D [page:Scene scene] object into 2D render data that can be rendered in a screen with your renderer of choice, projecting and clipping things out according to the used camera.
		</div>
		<div>
		If the <em>scene</em> were a real scene, this method would be the equivalent of taking a picture with the <em>camera</em> (and developing the film would be the next step, using a Renderer).
		</div>
